    Answer: c. 60

    Solution:

        Numbers from list:
        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

        Even numbers from list:

-- Question 2

-- Define a recursive function triangle :: Int -> Int that returns the sum of
-- all the natural numbers from its argument down to zero (inclusive). For example,
-- triangle 4 should return 10 (4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0).

-- Answer:
triangle :: Int -> Int
triangle 0 = 0
triangle num = num + triangle (num - 1)

-- The Fibonacci numbers are given by the sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13, ... in which
-- the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the
-- previous two numbers. Using pattern matching and recursion, define a function
-- fib :: Int -> Int that returns the nth Fibonacci number for any n ≥ 0. For
-- example, fib 3 should return 2.

-- Answer:
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

-- Explain how types are used in Haskell. As part of your answer, discuss the
-- various features the language provides for constructing types. Illustrate each of
-- the concepts that you mention with a small example in Haskell.

{-
    Answer:
    
    In Haskell, a new name for an existing type can be defined using a type declaration.
    Type declarations can be used to make other types easier to read. Like function definitions,
    type declarations can also have parameters.

    Example:

        type String = [Char]
        type Pos = (Int,Int)
        type Pair a = (a,a)

    A completely new type can be defined by specifying its values using a data declaration.
    Values of new types can be used in the same ways as those of built in types.
    The constructors in a data declaration can also have parameters.
    Data declarations themselves can also have parameters.

    Example:
        
        data Bool = False | True
        data Answer = Yes | No | Unknown
        data Shape = Circle Float | Rect Float Float
-}

-- Explain the terms “Recursion”, “Curried function” and “Higher-order function” and
-- give an example for each.

{-
    Answer:

        Recursion - a function that is defined in itself. Every recursion must have a base case
        otherwise the function will execute until it reaches a stack overflow. 
        Recursion is not restricted to numbers, but can also be used to define functions on lists. 

        rev :: [a] -> [a]  
        rev [] = []  
        rev (x:xs) = rev xs ++ [x]  

        Curried function - only takes one parameter at a time. 
        When you break downbreak down a function that takes multiple arguments 
        into a series of functions that each take only one argument.

        multThree :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a -> a  
        multThree x y z = x * y * z  

        how arguments are taken:
            a -> (a -> (a -> a))

        Higher-order function - a function that takes a function as parameters 
        and returns a function

        twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a  
        twice f x = f (f x) 

        zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]  
        zipWith _ [] _ = []  
        zipWith _ _ [] = []  
        zipWith f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith f xs ys

-- Define a function depth :: Tree -> Int that calculates the depth of a tree,
-- where the depth is given by the number of nodes in the longest path from the root
-- of the tree to a leaf in the tree

-- Answer:

treeDepth :: Tree -> Int
treeDepth (Leaf _) = 0
treeDepth (Node leftSubtree rightSubtree) = 
  1 + max (treeDepth leftSubtree) (treeDepth rightSubtree)

-- Let us say that a tree is full if every node has the property that the number of
-- leaves in its left and right subtrees are equal. Using size, define a function full
-- :: Tree -> Bool that decides if a tree is full.
